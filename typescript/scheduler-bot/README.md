## Setup

Before getting started, make sure you have a development workspace where you have permissions to install apps. If you
donâ€™t have one set up, go ahead and [create one](https://slack.com/create). Also, please note that the workspace
requires any of [the Slack paid plans](https://slack.com/pricing).

### Install the Slack CLI

To use this sample, you first need to install and configure the Slack CLI. Step-by-step instructions can be found in our
[Quickstart Guide](https://api.slack.com/future/quickstart).

## Create a Link Trigger

`slack trigger create --trigger-def "triggers/message_trigger.ts"`

## Local development

`slack run`\
And you will get a error like,\
`ðŸš«  Error: write tcp 000.00.000.000:00000->0.000.000.00:000: write: broken pipe`\
because API needs about 100 seconds to respond.

## Deploy

`slack deploy`
